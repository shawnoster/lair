# Lair

## Overview

Welcome to Lair, a loose collection of code things all centered around play tabletop games. It's also, and more importantly, a shared learning project where anyone can contribute to evolving Franksenstein's digitial buddy.

## Road Map

Road Map, you're hilarious, but here are a few thoughts:

- Random Dungeon Generator
  - create a service that returns useful data for random dungeon generation
  - front-end that displays a random dungeon

### Dice Roller

- create a service that accepts a free-form string (_3d6_) and returns the rolled value
- create a front-end that calls the service and does something cool

Current API end-points:

- [https://lair-dice.azurewebsites.net/diceroll/1d20] - Roll 1d20 dice
- [https://lair-dice.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html] - Swagger docs
