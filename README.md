# Lair

## Overview

Welcome to Lair, a loose collection of code things all centered around play tabletop games. It's also, and more importantly, a shared learning project where anyone can contribute to evolving Franksenstein's digitial buddy.

## Roadmap

Roadmap, you're hilarious, but here are a few thoughts:

- Dice Rolling
  - create a service that accepts a free-form string (_3d6_) and returns the rolled value
  - create a front-end that calls the service and does something cool
- Random Dungeon Generator
  - create a service that returns useful data for random dungeon generation
  - front-end that displays a random dungeon
